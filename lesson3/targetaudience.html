  <h1>Description of target audience</h1>
  <p>My target audience is is for people who are trying to plan events and activities around the weather.</p>

  <h2>Personas</h2>
  <h4>Persona 1</h4>
  <p>Coach Fernando is the lead scheduler for the boys soccer games. There are games every week except for when the weather gets really bad. He knows how much the boys enjoy playing  and tries to schedule the games on days sunny warm days. This doesn't always happen the way he wants it to sometimes the weather will be a little cold or so says the other weather website, and when he comes out its actually a warm. He found love your weather and it gives him scenarios of things you can do with that weather. After he has found Love You Weather he only ever misses a game when the whole week is raining or bad weather.</p>

  <h4>Persona 2</h4>

She has an outside wedding shes planning for but the last few she did the weather website she used was not as reliable. The last few weddings where still great but they weren't perfect because of the weather. This time she is determined to make it the perfect wedding. With Love Your Weather she is confidant she can plan the perfect outside wedding.</p>
